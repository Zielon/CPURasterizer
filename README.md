# CPURasterizer

Efficient CPU based rasterizer

CPU implementation of a very efficient rasterizer which utilizes `AVX2` instructions and lock-free multi-threading programming. Using tiled rendering the program consumes 8 pixels at the same time, which together with `std::execution` threading library makes it very fast and robust. The viewer of the project is a very simple OpenGL applicatoin which renders a texture to a quad. The texture is generated by the CPU `Renderer.h` class. The pipeline contains most of the modern GPU rasterizers stages.

Current development is available under [project](https://github.com/Zielon/CPURasterizer/projects/1). Discussion about the project is available [here](https://github.com/Zielon/CPURasterizer/discussions).

Implemented stages include:

```
- Vertex Shader
- Clipping (Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm)
- Rasterization (Larrabee paper)
- Perspective Corrected Interpolation
- Fragment Shader
- Depth Testing
```

Except rasterization pipeline the project contains serveral additional features. (More features will be developed soon)  

- Tiled rendering using AVX2 (2x4 pixels tile)
- Texture sampling
- OpenGL viewer (only texture rendering)
- C++17 (`std::execution` etc.)

### Performance

All tests were done on CPU Intel i4790k with 4 cores. 60 fps is the maximum for GLFW window.

| Scene         | Triangles | Shader | Filter  | FPS |
| ------------- |-----------|--------|---------|-----
| Cornell box   | 85k       |  Phong | Nearest |35   |
| Bedroom       | 1490k     |  Phong | Nearest |10.1 |
| Panther       | 2004k     |  Phong | Nearest | 6.3 |

### How to run

All dependencies needed for the project can be downloaded using `install.bat` for Windows or `install.sh` for Linux. The project has `Visual Studio 2019` solution and `CMake project`.

### Assets

The scene description and assets are taken from [GLSL-PathTracer](https://github.com/knightcrawler25/GLSL-PathTracer) project. The whole dataset can be downloaded from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UFMMoVb5uB7WIvCeHOfQ2dCQSxNMXluB/view).

Download the assets folder and place it in `/Rasterizer/Assets/Scenes/`. The folder structure has to be as follows:

```
/Rasterizer/Assets/Scenes/
    bedroom/
    coffee_cart/
    HDR/
    bedroom.scene
    coffee_cart.scene
    ...
```
